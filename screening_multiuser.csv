A key concern is that such activities might be done in an ad hoc manner, with little consideration of local relevance, audience and the integration of local experiences and knowledge. Drawing on the results gleaned from an interactive focus group with 10 climate change practitioners working in the region, this exploratory study investigates why raising awareness about climate change remains crucial, and importantly, how such activities might be done in a more relevant, meaningful and empowering way at the community level in the Pacific. This commentary argues that it is essential for communities to make local sense of climate change, particularly in an ever-changing world where knowledge is continuously expanding and changing. Initial findings suggest that making local sense of and raising awareness about climate change readily comes about with due consideration of approach, audience and context.",Mixed,Yes,Maybe,Yes,No,Mixed/Maybe,No,No,Yes,Unrated,,,,

We argue that notions of resilience, adaptation, and climate change itself mean something fundamentally different in Inuktitut than English and that this has implications for climate policy and politics. To the extent that climate change is translated into Inuktitut as a wholly environmental phenomenon over which humans have no control, both adaptation and resilience come to be seen as appropriate and distinctly Inuit modes of relating to shifting climatic conditions, calling on practices of patience, observation, creativity, forbearance, and discretion. If translated as a matter of unethical harm of sila, however, Inuit frameworks of justice, relationality, and healing would be activated. In the context of a broader global shift away from mitigation and toward enhancing the adaptive capacities and resilience of particular populations, current modes of translating climate change, we argue, are deeply political.",No,No,No,No,No,Unrated,Unrated,Unrated,Unrated,Unrated,,,,

This approach is particularly important at local scale since new general rules on emission abatement at European level can only marginally modify the most critical hotspots and may be very costly. This paper adapts the general Drivers, Pressures, State, Impacts, Responses (DPSIR) scheme proposed by the European Environment Agency to the specific case of local air quality policies and shows how the most recent scientific developments in impact evaluation and social acceptance can be integrated. The proposed decision framework represents a general methodology to design Integrated Assessment Modelling (IAM) systems aimed at the implementation of effective Air Quality Plans (AQP). An extensive survey across European countries shows the current degree of adoption of these approaches. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This is to support knowledge-based decision making and hence sustainable disaster risk reduction. In Malawi and most of Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), however, flood vulnerability assessments mainly focusing on social vulnerability, have been largely qualitative. The subjective nature of such qualitative assessments makes their use for identifying relative vulnerabilities of specific people and places, targeting of interventions, allocation of scarce resources and monitoring of benefits that may arise from interventions extremely problematic. Viewing vulnerability through exposure, susceptibility and capacity dimensions, all linked to social, economic, physical and environmental factors, this study has used an index-based approach to quantify and profile vulnerability to flooding of rural, subsistent communities in the Lower Shire Valley, Malawi. Results show that vulnerability to flooding is susceptibility-driven with susceptibility magnitudes manifesting as high to very high. In particular, socio-economic and to a large extent environmental susceptibilities are predominantly high to very high. Economic and physical capacities tend to be low but societal capacity tends to be high thereby attenuating overall capacity-induced vulnerability to medium levels. Physical exposure is medium. Except for environmental vulnerability, spatial differentiation in all forms of vulnerability across communities is in general marginal. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

We examined the effects of multi-decadal drying and drainage on plant community structure and productivity in four fens located in Alberta, Canada. Long-term drying resulted in a two to fourfold increase in total biomass in three of the four fen sites, with a similar large increase in NPP in Treed Fen 1. The treed poor fens consistently had decreased moss cover and productivity with drainage. Across all sites, changes in understory community composition were related to the change in water table position as well as overstory canopy development that occurred post-drainage. Overall, drainage induced a shift toward a drier peatland regime, favoring increased canopy and vascular plant density at the expense of ground-layer mosses or the understory. Within the ground layer communities, drainage favored dry-adapted hummock moss and lichen species over those wet-adapted but dessication-prone species typical of low-lying lawns and hollows. Alteration of fen vegetation due to ecosystem drying will not only influence carbon sequestration but also will increase the vulnerability of peatlands to wildfire, increasing the risk of further ecosystem degradation and possible loss of resilience.",No,No,No,No,No,Unrated,Unrated,Unrated,Unrated,Unrated,,,,

The transition to a green economy could reduce the risks of global climate changes and ameliorate the energy security, because of its capacity to use in a better way both natural resources and waste materials. The annual cost in natural capital degradation, in fact, is estimated at US$ 7.3 trillion, almost six time the cost of greening the economy, while ∼2 billion tons of wasted food is produced on the planet together with 50 million tons of electrical waste. Therefore, the necessity to change our way of living is a must of our society.

To improve the agricultural productivity and sustainability, the development of high-yielding stress-tolerant, and climate-resilient crops is essential. Of the abiotic stresses, flooding stress is a very serious hazard because it markedly reduces plant growth and grain yield. Proteomic analyses indicate that the effects of flooding stress are not limited to oxygen deprivation but include many other factors. Although many flooding response mechanisms have been reported, flooding tolerance mechanisms have not been fully clarified for soybean. There were limitations in soybean materials, such as mutants and varieties, while they were abundant in rice and Arabidopsis.

In the present study, we integrated observational climate data, one regional climate model, land use maps, and agricultural statistics to analyze the relationship between heat resources and multi-cropping potential in Shanghai. The results of agro-climatic assessment showed that climate change over the past 50 years has significantly enhanced regional agroclimatic resources, rendering a shift from double cropping to triple cropping possible. However, a downward trend is evident in the actual multi-cropping index, caused principally by the increasing costs of farming and limitations in the supply of labor.

The 2 heated treatments were then exposed to a 1 mo heat wave with an additional 5 degrees C temperature increase. For P. crispus, total biomass did not differ among the plants adapted to the different temperatures or between the 2 heated treatments for the duration of the experiment. Plants adapted to the highest temperatures, however, produced a larger number of smaller turions before the heat wave and allocated less biomass to elongation before and after the heat wave. For E. canadensis, the plants adapted to higher temperatures had higher total biomass before and during the heat wave and allocated more biomass to roots and leaves during the heat wave. Most indicators (e.g. length and biomass) of macrophyte performance measured during the experiment did not differ between the 2 heated treatments.

Flowering phenology plays a major role as a relevant set-point (i.e., biofix) in tree fruit pest and disease modelling. Projected climate change largely affects the range and phenology of pests and diseases, which requires adaptations of plant protection strategies to maintain their sustainability. The aim of the present study was (1) to elucidate a change in apple fruit phenology during the last decades and (2) to develop a simple heating model that only relies on present-year accumulated temperature sums. The results showed that apple flowering advanced on average 3.1 days/decade from 1960 to 2010. From 1981 to 2011, full bloom even advanced on average 5.1 days/decade. These shifts are similar to other phenological events of temperate deciduous trees reported in literature. For beginning of flowering, full bloom, and flowering termination (BBCH 60, 65, 69), the variation in temperature sums (coefficient of variation) was smallest for forcing day of year (DOY) 45 and forcing temperature threshold of 0°C. The corresponding temperature sums from DOY 45 were 10368 degree-hours (°h) (BBCH 60), 12546°h (BBCH 65), and 15914°h (BBCH 69). For BBCH 60 and 65, the validation of the simplified heating model for apple flowering revealed a good relationship between observed DOY and simulated DOY across all years and sites.

Coral disease surveys conducted twice yearly between 2008 and 2011 at a turbid inshore reef in the central Great Barrier Reef spanned two disturbance events, a coral bleaching event in 2009 and a severe cyclone (cyclone 'Yasi') in 2011. Surveys of coral cover, community structure and disease prevalence throughout this 4-yr study provide a unique opportunity to explore cumulative impacts of disturbance events and disease for inshore coral assemblages. The principal coral disease at the study site was atramentous necrosis (AtN), and it primarily affected the key inshore, reef-building coral Montipora aequituberculata. Other diseases detected were growth anomalies, white syndrome and brown band syndrome. Diseases affected eight coral genera, although Montipora was, by far, the genus mostly affected. The prevalence of AtN followed a clear seasonal pattern, with disease outbreaks occurring only in wet seasons. Mean prevalence of AtN on Montipora spp. (63.8 % +/- A 3.03) was three- to tenfold greater in the wet season of 2009, which coincided with the 2009 bleaching event, than in other years. Persistent wet season outbreaks of AtN combined with the impacts of bleaching and cyclone events resulted in a 50-80 % proportional decline in total coral cover. The greatest losses of branching and tabular acroporids occurred following the low-salinity-induced bleaching event of 2009, and the greatest losses of laminar montiporids occurred following AtN outbreaks in 2009 and in 2011 following cyclone Yasi.

Several empirical methods have been developed over the years to estimate potential evapotranspiration based on easily available parameters. Directly measured data of actual evapotranspiration have been rather sparse in the past and still need to be improved in particular regions like western Siberia. The transition zone between the warm temperate and cold temperate continental climates is very sensitive to climate change, and water stress is an increasingly important issue in these regions with a highly dynamic agricultural activity. So there is a growing need to estimate actual evapotranspiration. Widely usable approximations are needed. In this study, the values of potential evapotranspiration computed with the original version, and eight modifications of the Penman formulation were compared and related to the actual evapotranspiration measured by eddy covariance over a grassland area in western Siberia. The original 1948 and 1963 Penman formulations are best for estimating potential evapotranspiration in the transition zone between the forest steppes and the pre-taiga. A nearly linear relationship between the potential and actual evapotranspiration was found. A simple modification of the Penman equation (i.e. the multiplication of the result by a factor of 0.47) is suggested for approximating the actual evapotranspiration based on standard meteorological data for the region. The original Penman formulation is most robust and will provide the widest applicability in the future under changing climate and environmental conditions. In this context, it is further recommended not to neglect the ventilation term of the Penman equation, which is often assumed to be negligibly small. A detailed correlation analysis showed that under dry soil conditions, the vegetation largely contributed to the actual evapotranspiration and, in contrast to widely held expectations, that the Penman equation is best adapted to vegetated surfaces.

They then specify the various factors influencing behaviour in the direction of sustainable consumption (or not) and the different types of strategies of intervention that are likely to modify those behaviours. Lastly, they detail two targeted strategies, one aimed at the ""precarious seniors"" milieu and the other at the ""eco-elite"" milieu.

272955,https://apsis.mcc-berlin.net/scoping/document/193/272955/,"Effect of climatic factors such as temperature, precipitation on maize production in China","Impacts of climate change on agriculture has received wide concerns globally, yet a number of questions such as how past climate change affected the crop yields, which climatic variables were the main contributor for observed yield reduction remained unanswered to date, particularly in developing countries. Information about the climatic risks posed on crop growth, and yield responses to the specific climatic risks is prerequisite for understanding the underlying mechanisms of climate change impacts and devising appropriate adaptation strategies. This study first identified the changes of growing-season climatic variables (temperature, precipitation, and solar radiation) from 1982-2006 for China's maize production. Using the relationships between changes in survey maize yield and climatic variables and their spatial variations, we investigated and untangled the impacts of different climatic variables on maize yield. Our analysis demonstrated that the growing-season temperatures, including daily maximum, minimum and mean temperatures, exhibited significant increase during 1981-2006, indicating the potential climatic risks for maize growth in China. Growing-season diurnal temperature range, precipitation and solar radiation also exhibited detectable changes, but limited to small parts of the maize area. During 1981-2006, there were significant negative correlations between national maize yield and temperatures (include mean, maximum, and minimum temperatures). Maize yield in some maize areas also exhibited linear correlation relationship to growing-season diurnal temperature range, solar radiation, and precipitation. With a 1℃ warming in growing-season temperature, 1℃ increase in diurnal temperature range, a 10% decrease in radiation and precipitation, much of the maize area showed detectable yield response to these changes. Maize experienced depressed yield to the 1℃ warming in growing-season temperature, denoting by roughly a quarter of China's maize area exhibiting depressed yield and an estimated reduction of 25.1% across the regions that have detectable negative yield responses. The four climatic variables have diverse impacts on the maize yield in terms of the magnitude of yield change and the spatial variation of yield response. We identified the key climatic factor for observed maize yield change for all maize area. Temperature appeared as the first key climatic driver for maize yield change in over 40% maize area, while diurnal temperature range acted as a main player in 23% maize area. Radiation and precipitation shared a small and similar portion of maize area for playing as the key climatic variables for the yield response. We recognized the uncertainties in our study some of which came from reliability of data resource and the use of statistical method. However, this study provided first hand information on maize yield response to historical climatic risks, which advanced the understanding of underlying mechanism of climate change impacts on China's maize production and assisted the projection of maize yield for future climate change. ©, 2014, Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

315935,https://apsis.mcc-berlin.net/scoping/document/193/315935/,What determines tree mortality in dry environments? a multi-perspective approach,"Forest ecosystems function under increasing pressure due to global climate changes, while factors determining when and where mortality events will take place within the wider landscape are poorly understood. Observational studies are essential for documenting forest decline events, understanding their determinants, and developing sustainable management plans. A central obstacle towards achieving this goal is that mortality is often patchy across a range of spatial scales, and characterized by long-term temporal dynamics. Research must therefore integrate different methods, from several scientific disciplines, to capture as many relevant informative patterns as possible. We performed a landscape-scale assessment of mortality and its determinants in two representative Pinus halepensis planted forests from a dry environment (similar to 300 mm), recently experiencing an unprecedented sequence of two severe drought periods. Three data sources were integrated to analyze the spatiotemporal variation in forest performance: (1) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time-series, from 18 Landsat satellite images; (2) individual dead trees point-pattern, based on a high-resolution aerial photograph; and (3) Basal Area Increment (BAI) time-series, from dendrochronological sampling in three sites. Mortality risk was higher in older-aged sparse stands, on southern aspects, and on deeper soils. However, mortality was patchy across all spatial scales, and the locations of patches within ""high-risk"" areas could not be fully explained by the examined environmental factors. Moreover, the analysis of past forest performance based on NDVI and tree rings has indicated that the areas affected by each of the two recent droughts do not coincide. The association of mortality with lower tree densities did not support the notion that thinning semiarid forests will increase survival probability of the remaining trees when facing extreme drought. Unique information was obtained when merging dendrochronological and remotely sensed performance indicators, in contrast to potential bias when using a single approach. For example, dendrochronological data suggested highly resilient tree growth, since it was based only on the ""surviving"" portion of the population, thus failing to identify past demographic changes evident through remote sensing. We therefore suggest that evaluation of forest resilience should be based on several metrics, each suited for detecting transitions at a different level of organization.",No,No,No,No,No,Unrated,Unrated,Unrated,Unrated,Unrated,,,,

Climate warming, geopolitical pressures such as environmental refugees, an aging population, and a sluggish economy have overwhelmed the region's efforts to find a balance that would have ensured human prosperity without diminishing the integrity of the Great Lakes basin.

Impacts of education programs, opposition to environmentally degrading natural resource extraction, and widespread effects of both failing social services and physical infrastructure galvanize grassroots mobilization of communities around ""iceless hockey rink"" meetings. These meetings act as a catalyst, translating this social movement into governance that works towards a common vision based on shared values.

In previous work the erect-forms Molgula pedunculata and Cnemidocarpa verrucosa (Order Stolidobranchiata) appeared more sensitive than the flat form Ascidia challengeri (Order Phlebobranchiata). Sedimentation exposure is expected to induce up-regulation of anaerobic metabolism by obstructing the organs of gas exchange (environmental hypoxia) or causes enhanced squirting activity (functional hypoxia). In this study we evaluated the possible relationship between ascidian morphotype and their physiological response to sedimentation. Together with some behavioural observations, we analysed the response of anaerobic metabolic parameters (lactate formation and glycogen consumption) in different tissues of three Antarctic ascidians, exposed to high sediment concentrations (200 mgL(-1)). The results were compared to experimental hypoxia (10% pO(2)) and exercise (induced muscular contraction) effects, in order to discriminate the effect of sediment on each species and morpho-type (erect vs. flat forms). Our results suggest that the styled (erect) C. verrucosa increases muscular squirting activity in order to expulse excessive material, while the flat-form A. challengeri reacts more passively by down-regulating its aerobic metabolism under sediment exposure. Contrary, the erect ascidian M. pedunculata did not show any measurable response to the treatments, indicating that filtration and ingestion activities were not reduced or altered even under high sedimentation (low energetic material) which could be disadvantageous on the long-term and could explain why M pedunculata densities decline in the study area.

In the simplest form of this dispersal, pine pollen ascends vertically to altitudes of 2 to 6 km, where a fraction is captured by mixed-phase cloud formation. Captured pollen accretes into frozen droplets, which ultimately descend as rain, snow, or hail. Whether Pinus pollen can still germinate after its exposure to high-altitude freezing is pertinent to (1) how forests adapt to climate change and (2) potential gene flow between genetically modified plantation species and their conspecific relatives. Methods: To address this question, pollen from four Old World and two New World Pinus species were subjected to immersion freezing, a common cloud formation mode, under laboratory conditions. Key Results: Some pollen grains immersed at -20 degrees C for 15, 60, or 120 min in either a dehydrated or a water-saturated state were still capable of germination. After exposure, dehydrated pine pollen had higher germination (43.3%) than water-saturated pollen (7.6%). Conclusions: Pine pollen exposed to freezing during cloud formation can still germinate, raising the question of whether rain-delivered live pollen might be linked to rain-facilitated pollination.

Our case study is Santander, a coastal region in Northern Spain. The case-study specific natural hazards concern (a) sea-level rise, high tides and extreme wave events that lead to floods and beach erosion, (b) rise in sea temperature that leads to invasive jellyfish blooms and changes in native biodiversity. In particular, we employ a choice experiment (CE) to elicit the value locals place on improvements, through the implementation of appropriate mitigation measures, in biodiversity, recreational opportunities and on decreases in health risks associated with jellyfish blooms. Results suggest that people value positively benefits in terms of increased biodiversity and recreation opportunities, as well as health risk reductions, and point to interesting policy implications.

Successful MPAs ultimately depend on knowledge-based decision making, where scientific research is integrated into management actions. Fourteen coral reef MPA managers and sixteen academics from eleven research, state and federal government institutions each outlined at least five pertinent research needs for improving the management of MPAs situated in Australian coral reefs. From this list of 173 key questions, we asked members of each group to rank questions in order of urgency, redundancy and importance, which allowed us to explore the extent of perceptional mismatch and overlap among the two groups. Our results suggest the mismatch among MPA managers and academics is small, with no significant difference among the groups in terms of their respective research interests, or the type of questions they pose. However, managers prioritised spatial management and monitoring as research themes, whilst academics identified climate change, resilience, spatial management, fishing and connectivity as the most important topics. Ranking of the posed questions by the two groups was also similar, although managers were less confident about the achievability of the posed research questions and whether questions represented a knowledge gap. We conclude that improved collaboration and knowledge transfer among management and academic groups can be used to achieve similar objectives and enhance the knowledge-based management of MPAs.

Design/methodology/approach - In total, 662 fish farmers in sites across Northern Thailand were interviewed about risks to the profitability of their fish farms and ways such risks were managed. Nonlinear canonical correlation analysis was used to relate risk factors to management practices at farm and river levels. In total, 68 in-depth interviews with farmers and other stakeholders provided additional information on climate risk management practices. Findings - Farmers use a combination of adjustments to rearing practices, cropping calendars and financial and social measures to manage those risks, which they perceive as being manageable. Many risks are season, river and place specific; implying that the risk profiles of individual farms can vary substantially. Individual risks are often addressed through multiple practices and strategies; conversely, a particular management practice can have a bearing on several different risks. Farmers recognize that risks must be managed at farm and higher spatial and administrative scales. Social relations and information play critical roles in managing these complex combinations of risks. Originality/value - This is one of the first papers to report in detail on how inland fish farmers manage climate-related risks. It underlines the need to consider multiple spatial and temporal scales and that farmers do not manage individual climate-related risks in isolation from other risks.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Mixed/Maybe,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,,,,

Variation among individuals, especially in response to parasites, directly affects population dynamics and how populations respond to management. Immune function, therefore is a key individual-level trait that influences demographic characteristics and life-history traits because it directly affects the survival outcome of a parasitic challenge. Mounting an immune response is expensive in energy and resources and, thus, the principle of allocation predicts that trade-offs will occur with other energetically demanding tasks, such as survival or reproduction. Therefore, understanding immune function in wild animals is important for predicting how animal populations will respond to management, and we recommend that managers integrate data on immune function into larger studies of population dynamics and management of populations. In this review, we introduce how types of immune function are classified within traditional immunology and the emerging field of ecological immunology (ecoimmunology). We also review the resources available to wildlife managers for learning about techniques in ecoimmunology, and provide guidance for developing studies of immune function within larger projects on demography among populations.",No,No,No,No,No,Unrated,Unrated,Unrated,Unrated,Unrated,,,,

We used mark-recapture and analysis of shell rings to investigate age and growth of the hyriid, Westralunio carteri, at 5 sites in southwestern Australia. We tested the utility of the in situ marker calcein for validating the assumption of annulus formation in adults. Calcein was incorporated into the shells of all recovered individuals, but it provided an interpretable reference mark in only 4 of 16 individuals. These 4 individuals produced 1 shell ring subsequent to the mark, supporting the assumption of annulus production during the austral winter. Maximum age ranged among populations from 36 to 52 y and maximum size ranged from 72.9 to 82.8 mm. Mean age and length did not differ between sexes, and growth trajectories differed between sexes at only 1 site. Estimates of growth measured by the von Bertalanffy growth constant, K, ranged from 0.021 to 0.336 among sites. Estimates from mark-recapture experiments were 20 to 52% lower than values from shell annuli at all sites except 1 where K from shell annuli was similar to 1/2 that estimated from mark-recapture. Both methods showed a positive relationship between K and mean water temperature among sites, suggesting a role of riparian shading in regulating stream temperature, and hence, indirectly influencing mussel growth. Mussel growth and mean N or P concentrations were not related among sites, but total N at the site with highest mussel growth was >2x higher than at any other site. Westralunio carteri is a long-lived, slow-growing bivalve. Maximum age, K, and probable age at maturity (4-6 y) are similar to other slow-growing freshwater bivalve groups. This suite of life-history traits is considered an adaptation for stable aquatic habitats. Therefore, W. carteri can be expected to adapt poorly to human impacts, such as riparian clearing and water extraction, which increase the temporal variability of environmental conditions in streams.",No,No,No,No,No,Unrated,Unrated,Unrated,Unrated,Unrated,,,,

The lens of complex systems science yields insights into facets of forest structure and dynamics that facilitate comparisons among ecosystems. These biomes share the main properties of complex systems but differ in specific ecological properties, disturbance regimes, and human uses.

In these ecosystems, the effects of large wildfires are potentially high on small and relatively less mobile animals, like small mammals. We investigated the effects of an extensive wildfire (approximate to 6,240 ha) in September 2011 on populations of 2 arboreal-scansorial small mammals-the gracile mouse opossum, Gracilinanus agilis, and the long-tailed climbing mouse, Rhipidomys macrurus-in 4 savanna woodland patches (1 burned, 3 unburned) of the highly threatened Brazilian Cerrado. We assessed population densities from 2009 to 2013 and for G. agilis, we estimated apparent survival and recapture probabilities with Cormack-Jolly-Seber models. Both species showed strong, negative fire responses, including sudden collapse and slow recovery (at least more than 1 year). These observed responses were probably a consequence of both the phytophysiognomic features of the habitat and severity of the fire with the resulting changes on the vertical structure of vegetation. The studied species of Cerrado forested formations were not as resilient to fire disturbance as typical species from savanna or temperate woodlands. As a consequence of human activities and climate changes, fire events are predicted to become larger and more frequent in the Brazilian Cerrado. Therefore, it is imperative to create new management strategies to protect forested physiognomies from fire, especially cerradao, which is very fire sensitive and has a limited and scattered distribution in the landscape.",No,No,No,No,No,Unrated,Unrated,Unrated,Unrated,Unrated,,,,

Objective: The objective was to estimate neurodevelopmental disability and associated costs that can be reasonably attributed to EDC exposure in the European Union. Design: An expert panel applied a weight-of-evidence characterization adapted from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Exposure-response relationships and reference levels were evaluated for relevant EDCs, and biomarker data were organized from peer-reviewed studies to represent European exposure and approximate burden of disease. Cost estimation as of 2010 utilized lifetime economic productivity estimates, lifetime cost estimates for autism spectrum disorder, and annual costs for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. Setting, Patients and Participants, and Intervention: Cost estimation was carried out from a societal perspective, ie, including direct costs (eg, treatment costs) and indirect costs such as productivity loss. Results: The panel identified a 70-100% probability that polybrominated diphenyl ether and organophosphate exposures contribute to IQ loss in the European population. Polybrominated diphenyl ether exposures were associated with 873 000 (sensitivity analysis, 148 000 to 2.02 million) lost IQ points and 3290 (sensitivity analysis, 3290 to 8080) cases of intellectual disability, at costs of (sic) 9.59 billion (sensitivity analysis, (sic)1.58 billion to (sic)22.4 billion).

In vulnerable regions, like Southern Europe, where most of the residential buildings still rely on natural ventilation for cooling, impact on thermal comfort can be significant in terms of health, well-being and also energy consumption. The question is particularly important for the existing building stock, which was not designed considering the projected future climate conditions and is prone to be subjected to interventions with the purpose of improving thermal. performance. The study presents a vulnerability framework and methodology for the assessment of thermal comfort in existing dwellings in the context of climate change. Results relating to a 1960s typical building case study in Lisbon, Portugal, suggest that specific dwelling characteristics, such as orientation, and occupancy profiles are relevant when assessing vulnerability, suggesting significant differences, of up to 91% in discomfort hours on an annual basis. Furthermore, increased insulation seems to be effective in decreasing discomfort, as the best results (48% in discomfort hours decrease) stem from a context of external insulation for a heatwave situation. The methodology can be useful for assessing vulnerability in existing dwellings and its specific conditions. It can also contribute to understanding the effect of energy retrofitting measures in future climate conditions, assisting energy efficiency policies and decision-making regarding retrofit interventions.

However, because the potential ecological and political side effects of SRM are not well understood, and because SRM will cross national boundaries, an international research perspective on the general public's perception of this technology is required. We conducted an online survey on the general public's perception and acceptance of SRM in Canada, China, Germany, Switzerland, the UK, and the USA. Our findings confirmed the need for an international perspective, as we found several cross-country differences. Chinese respondents, for example, indicated greater acceptance for SRM than their North American and European counterparts. Moreover, results of regression analyses on acceptance of SRM by country revealed that lower acceptability ratings for SRM in Canada and Europe were mostly related to stronger beliefs that SRM tampers with nature. Chinese respondents, by contrast, were more accepting of SRM when they held stronger beliefs that it may reduce the motivation to adopt burdensome climate change mitigation efforts. Although our research-and previous studies-suggest that opposition to SRM remains, dismissing the technology entirely on these grounds and without conducting a careful, cross-national, and transdisciplinary decision-support process to set up an international policy regime seems premature as people from countries that are less prepared to mitigate and adapt to climate change seem to be more supportive of SRM.",No,No,No,No,No,Unrated,Unrated,Unrated,Unrated,Unrated, Mitigation focused                   ,,,

PET is calculated using the Hargreaves model with monthly mean, maximum, and minimum temperatures and a 1 km spatial resolution, which are generated using the Delta downscaling method and general circulation models (GCMs) with four representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios. The PET trend is detected via Mann-Kendall and Sen's slope estimator tests. The following results are drawn: (1) the Delta downscaling method shows a favorable performance in detecting GCM monthly temperatures based on the mean absolute error and regression analysis between downscaled data and independent surface observations. Among the 28 GCMs, the NorESM1-M and GISS-E2-R models show the best performance in reproducing the monthly mean/maximum and minimum temperatures over the Loess Plateau, respectively; (2) the average annual PET over this region will increase by 12.7%-23.9% from 1961 to 1990 to the end of this century (2071-2100). However, these increments show strong spatial variations; (3) the annual PET during the 2011-2100 period at each grid of the region demonstrates a significantly increasing trend under each RCP scenario, while RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0, and RCP8.5 have average magnitudes of trend of 10.4 mm/10yr, 17.7 mm/10yr, 21 mm/10yr, and 29.7 min/10yr, respectively; (4) the annual PET with significant trends during the other three periods (2011-2040, 2041-2070, and 2071-2100) presentvarious spatial distributions in their magnitudes of trend under the aforementioned RCP scenarios. RCP2.6 showed a significant decrease during 2041-2070 and 2071-2100, although such trends are only observed at 0.3% and 1.2% of the Loess Plateau, respectively; and (5) the spatial results provide some information, such as locations and area ratios, which are valuable in assessing future PET changes and trends.

To estimate the long-term yield response to changes in temperature and precipitation as well as the short-term response to key adverse weather events (e.g. heavy precipitation, drought and heat stress) on the yields of vegetable crops, we used several statistical approaches with six daily impact-indicators, the four monthly drought indices and the climate trends. Our study integrated a newly available historical yield dataset at the district level (the finest spatial resolution) for all highly marketable vegetables (celeriac, late carrots, root parsley, early kohlrabi, summer savoy cabbage, late cauliflower, late cabbage, onions, green peas, tomatoes, salad and pickling cucumbers) and a high-resolution historical climate dataset (seven daily meteorological variables at a 10x10km resolution) over a 54-year period in the Czech Republic (CZ). Different indices were used to reflect different dimensions of water and heat stress, which have different impacts on vegetable growth and yield. We find positive long-term impacts of recent warming on fruiting vegetables (from 4.9 to 12.2%degrees C-1) but decreases in the yield stability of traditionally grown root vegetables in the warmest areas of the country. Short-term extreme temperature variabilities (days with heat stress) were found to be the dominant type of adverse event for tomato and cucumber production due to its effect on increased soil water demand, which increased transpiration rates, whereas changes in both the diurnal temperature ranges and minimum temperature (Tmin) were associated with minimal risk of frost damage. Brassicas vegetables are widely irrigated in the CZ, but irrigation does not fully mitigate drought effects; hence, short-term extreme precipitation variability largely controls crop production in the growing districts. The high frequencies of dry days and days with heavy precipitation within the critical growth stages of brassicas reflect a competition between more dry days and greater precipitation intensity on wet days. The yield variability of bulbs is largely explained by both short-term extreme precipitation and temperature variability (drought-heat stress), which reflects the predominantly rain-fed system of onion cultivation. Both drought and heat stress and changes in Tmin were important in explaining yield losses of root vegetables. Legumes had the lowest risk of multiple stresses during their short growth cycle, but droughts remain the dominant type of adverse event. Years with yield gains were substantially more common than years with yield losses for brassicas, bulbs and legumes vegetables in all of the cultivated regions.",No,No,No,No,No,Unrated,Unrated,Unrated,Unrated,Unrated,,,,

Planners therefore face a challenge of multidimensional, spatial optimization in order to balance potential tradeoffs and maximize synergies between risks and other objectives. To address this, a spatial optimization framework has been developed. This uses a spatially implemented genetic algorithm to generate a set of Pareto-optimal results that provide planners with the best set of trade-off spatial plans for six risk and sustainability objectives: (i) minimize heat risks, (ii) minimize flooding risks, (iii) minimize transport travel costs to minimize associated emissions, (iv) maximize brownfield development, (v) minimize urban sprawl, and (vi) prevent development of greenspace. The framework is applied to Greater London (U.K.) and shown to generate spatial development strategies that are optimal for specific objectives and differ significantly from the existing development strategies. In addition, the analysis reveals tradeoffs between different risks as well as between risk and sustainability objectives. While increases in heat or flood risk can be avoided, there are no strategies that do not increase at least one of these. Tradeoffs between risk and other sustainability objectives can be more severe, for example, minimizing heat risk is only possible if future development is allowed to sprawl significantly. The results highlight the importance of spatial structure in modulating risks and other sustainability objectives.

We found that overall vulnerability was very high, with very low absorptive and coping capacity for potential impacts of climate change. Moreover, vulnerability and coping strategies were socially differentiated in terms of the decision-making capability and resource capacity of households. Two groups per category (good and bad decision makers; poor and poorer households) were distinguished. The exposure dimension of vulnerability differed significantly by resource capacity and decision capability.

A proactive energy management process, addressing the optimal energy utilisation through dynamic cooperation of the wall and the SE, is presented in this paper. Based on probabilistic weather forecast and a SGH thermal model, found by system identification, the operation set-points are optimised proactively by minimising the plant probable thermal ""cost"" and weather-related risk in a scheduling period to take pre-emptory action against potential emergencies. The optimisation is formulated in a two-level control scheme. A master problem optimises the primary (wall-soil) storage operation against the expected weather, and a sub-problem operates the SE as a supplement to the limited wall storage in order to create a better indoor environment. The main task of the slave problem manager is to find the optimal SE operation under probable extreme weather to keep reserves to minimise any risk of severe crop loss. The overall optimisation is solved by a hybrid evolutionary algorithm based on a genetic algorithm. The tests show good potential for energy saving and crop cold stress minimisation, as well as great tolerance to forecast errors for most of the cases in Monte-Carlo simulation.

However, the threat of seawater intrusion iswidespread in coastal aquifers mainly due to overexploitation of groundwater. In the present study, a modified fuzzy multicriteria categorization into non-ordered categories method was developed in order to modify the standard GALDIT method and assess seawater intrusion vulnerability in a coastal aquifer of northern Greece. The method is based on six parameters: groundwater occurrence, aquifer hydraulic conductivity, groundwater level, distance from the shore, impact of the existing status of seawater intrusion, and aquifer thickness. Initially, the originalmethodwas applied and revealed a zone of high vulnerability running parallel to the coastline and covering an area of 8.6 km(2). Themodified GALDIT-Fmethod achieved higher discretization of vulnerability zones which is essential to build a rational management plan to prevent seawater intrusion. The GALDIT-F approach also distinguished an area of the aquifer that is influenced by geothermal fluids. In total, twenty-five categories were produced corresponding to different vulnerability degrees according to the initial method (High, Moderate, Low) as well as the area influenced by geothermal fluids. Finally, a road map was developed in order to adapt management strategies to GALDIT-F categories and prevent and mitigate seawater intrusion. The proposed management strategies of the coastal aquifer include managed aquifer recharge (MAR) implementation, reallocation of existing wells, optimization of pumping rates during the hydrological year, and a detailed monitoring plan.

Worse still, the impact of multiple anthropic stressors on species dynamics could complicate adaptation to temperature increase. International conservation policies aim to protect ecosystems against anthropic pressures, but their ability to facilitate adaptation to climate change has yet to be assessed. Using wetland bird monitoring surveys, we evaluated the differences at the country scale of community adjustment to temperature increase of wintering waterbird communities (145 species) according to the implementation of the two main western Palearctic international conservation policies (Bern Convention and Birds Directive) in the Mediterranean basin (2786 sites, 22 countries) over a 22-year period. We showed that thermic community composition increases over time in countries which have enforced conservation policies. We found that strictly protected species under the Birds Directive and the Bern Convention contributed more to this community adjustment than the not strictly protected species. The mechanism results from a population increase in protected warm-dwelling species but not from a decline in cold-dwelling species.

In this study, we performed a re-visitation study using historical and newly collected vegetation plots to explore the primary trends in the floristic, ecological, and structural features of Mediterranean Pinus mugo krummholz over past decades. The plant community composition over time (1992 vs. 2016-17) was analyzed by a detrended correspondence analysis followed by a statistical comparison of time steps and an analysis of the contribution of each species to temporal differences. Ecological and structural changes were analyzed by a permutational multivariate analysis of variance followed by a post hoc comparison. We observed relevant changes in the floristic composition, structure, and ecological characteristics of Pinus mugo scrub. Some subalpine and treeline species that characterize the early stages of Pinus mugo succession declined as several warm-adapted species increased. Furthermore, these changes were most likely due to the natural evolution of high-mountain krummholz combined with a thermophilization process occurring in alpine habitats. In contrast, a small group of cold-adapted species also increased, probably because the patchy spatial pattern of Pinus mugo scrubs gives rise to mesic patches in a matrix of arid grasslands.

However, there is limited attention in the region to emerging initiatives, technologies and policies that are tailored to building the adaptive capacity of agricultural systems to climate change and variability. In this paper, we discuss the prospects for climate-smart agriculture technologies and enabling policies in dealing with climate change and variability at different sub-regional levels of sub-Saharan Africa to sustain farm productivity and livelihoods of agrarian communities. The review provides substantial information suggesting that without appropriate interventions, climate change and variability will affect agricultural yields, food security and add to the presently unaceptable levels of poverty in sub-Saharan Africa. Although some of them were already existing, the past decades have seen the development and promotion of climate-smart agriculture innovations such as the use of high yielding drought tolerant crop varieties, climate information services, agricultural insurance, agroforestry, water harvesting techniques, integrated soil fertility management practices, etc. In the context of climate change, this appears as a stepping up approach to sustainably improving farm productivity, rural livelihoods and adaptive capacity of farmers and production systems while contributing to mitigation. The development of regional, sub-regional and national climate change policies and plans targeted at mitigating climate change and improving adaptive capacity of the African people have also been developed to enable mainstreaming of climate-smart agriculture into agricultural development plans.

According to an analysis of seasonal and regional drought characteristics on the Korean Peninsula, drought occurs most frequently in spring, and the central and southern areas are generally more vulnerable to drought. Drought risk analysis under various climate change scenarios indicates significant drought risk over the entire Korean Peninsula excepting some parts of the Han and Nakdong river basins from 2011 to 2040. Extreme drought may be particularly severe in the mid-west area as these basins lack available water resources. Drought risk decreases in the southern Korean Peninsula in the 2011-2040 and 2071-2099 periods, during which the area vulnerable to drought also decreases. However, some parts of central Korea and the western and eastern coastlines remain susceptible to drought.

This paper describes the effect of these factors on two major determinants of the local carbon cycle: litter decomposition and carbon stabilization. In order to adequately reflect local heterogeneity, we have sampled 12 typical plant communities of the Russian Caucasus. In order to minimize confounding effects and encourage comparative studies, we have adapted the widely used tea bag index (TBI) that is typically used in areas with low decomposition. By incubating standardized tea litter for a year, we investigated whether (1) initial litter decomposition rate (k) is negatively correlated with litter stabilization (S) and (2) whether k or S exhibit correlations with altitude and other environmental conditions. Our results show that S and k are not correlated. Altitude, pH, and water content significantly influenced the stabilization factor S, while soil-freezing had no influence. In contrast, none of these factors predicted the decomposition rate k. Based on our data, we argue that collection of decomposition rates alone, as is now common practice, is not sufficient to understand carbon input to soils and can potentially lead to misleading results.

The survey included Likert-scored responses and multiple-choice questions, and was completed by 452 participants, including conventional and organic farmers and ranchers, extension agents, crop consultants, and researchers. The results indicate that while a notable fraction of agricultural stakeholders are alarmed about climate change and optimistic about the human capacity to reduce climate change, the degree of concern and optimism significantly varies depending on the stakeholder's political views, production region, and agricultural occupation group. We found that observations of changes in climate, perceptions about climate change, and potential risks to agricultural production are driven mainly by political views.

To assess the potential occurrence of Zika transmission throughout Argentina by the mosquito Aedes aegypti considering the basic reproduction number (R-0). Methods. A model originally developed for dengue was adapted for Zika. R-0 was estimated as a function of seven parameters, three of them were considered temperature-dependent. Seasonal Zika occurrence was evaluated in 9 locations representing different climatic suitability for the vector. Data of diary temperatures were extracted and included in the model. A threshold of R-0 =1 was fixed for Zika occurrence. Sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the uncertainty around the results. Results. Zika transmission has the potential to occur in all studied locations at least in some moment of the year. In the northern region, transmission might be possible throughout the whole year or with an interruption in winter. The maximum R-0 was estimated in 6.9, which means an average of 7 secondary cases from a primary case. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that during winter the transmission can only be excluded in the southern fringe of geographic distribution of the vector and in part of central Argentina. Conclusion. Zika virus has the potential to be transmitted in Argentina throughout the current geographic range of the mosquito vector. Although the transmission would be mainly seasonal, the possibility of winter transmission cannot be excluded in northern and central Argentina, meaning that there is a potential endemic maintenance of the disease.",No,No,No,No,No,Unrated,Unrated,Unrated,Unrated,Unrated,impacts focused                    ,,,

Previous investigations showed a correlation between mitochondrial DNA identity of populations and climatic conditions related to winter; however, the lack of biomarkers hampers investigations to test whether geographically distinct populations do show specific molecular responses to low temperatures or whether they possess specific genetic identity at loci functionally related to cold response. The present study was designed to identify candidate protein biomarkers and biological processes that are associated with cold acclimation of overwintering H. euphorbiae diapause pupae. Specimens taken from a single central European population were gradually cooled from 20 degrees C to -2 degrees C over 36 days and 12 differentially abundant proteins were identified. In addition, DeepSuperSAGE sequencing technology was applied to study differentially regulated genes. There was incongruence between differentially abundant proteins and differentially expressed genes, but functional characteristics of regulated proteins and analyses of gene ontology term enrichment among differentially regulated genes pointed to activation of the same biological processes, e. g. oxidative stress response.

This challenge is made greater by a world that is increasingly becoming warmer. Such environmental changes dramatically impact head rice and milling yield as well as increasing chalkiness because of impairment in starch accumulation and other storage biosynthetic pathways in the grain. This review highlights the knowledge gained through gene discovery via quantitative trait locus (QTL) cloning and structural-functional genomic strategies to reduce chalk, increase head rice yield, and develop stable lines with optimum grain quality in challenging environments. The newly discovered genes and the knowledge gained on the influence of specific alleles related to stability of grain quality attributes provide a robust platform for marker-assisted selection in breeding to design heat-tolerant rice varieties with superior grain quality.

Evolutionary adaptation of the human female pelvis to vaginal deliveries brings with it many benefits, but risks still exist. These benefits and risks should be discussed with patients prior to delivery. Currently, no consensus exists on a standard informed consent process prior to normal vaginal delivery. OBJECTIVES: To synopsize the current literature regarding the ethics of informed consent in the setting of obstetric and gynecological practice, and to make the case for informed consent for vaginal delivery prior to labor. DISCUSSION: Vaginal birth is still viewed as the default method of delivery. The reason for this is not unrelated to the direct connection between the uterus that holds the fetus before labor, and the vagina, for which the term birth canal was given even before modern obstetrics. Although there are known benefits for advocating vaginal births, there are also attendant risks. CONCLUSION: It is incumbent on obstetricians and midwives to discuss those risk and benefits with their patient prior to labor. Verbal discussion without documentation may no longer be appropriate due to medical advancements and the litigious health care climate. For this reason, we argue for and advocate that a consent process be included as an educational measure and as part of our ethical obligation to provide care.",No,No,No,No,No,Unrated,Unrated,Unrated,Unrated,Unrated,not climate-related                    ,,,

It is however debatable whether geographic trends in adult body size are accompanied by corresponding differences in juvenile growth rate (= mass gain per unit time). Respective studies have been complicated by conceptual and methodological problems related to defining and measuring this variable, particularly in organisms with discontinuous growth like arthropods. Using an original method for estimating differential (instantaneous) juvenile growth rates, we compared geographically distant European populations of six insect species in a common garden experiment. We found no among population differences in differential growth rate in any of the species. This result is in concert with concurrent increase in both adult size and developmental time towards the south. While opposite examples exist, we interpret our results as challenging the view that growth rate is a trait that readily responds to environmentally based selective pressures. Our results thus advocate the more classical view of growth rate maximisation within its physiological limits.

Such areas are often densely populated and salt intrusion in drinking water frequent.

Technology transfer and the adoption of low-tech protected cultivation techniques affordable for smallholders are believed to be able to meet this challenge. Protected cultivation techniques are a set of agricultural practices aimed at artificializing the crop environment through the use of soil covers and/or plant covers to control pests and climatic conditions. Although protected cultivation techniques may increase the yield and quality of vegetable crops and extend their production periods worldwide, the transfer of these techniques in sub-Saharan Africa raises questions about their agronomical performances, their profitability but also their environmental impacts. Are low-tech protected cultivation techniques adapted to the sustainable production of vegetables by smallholders in sub-Saharan Africa? To answer this question, we present an overview of the agronomic, economic, and environmental performances of low-tech protected cultivation techniques in sub-Saharan Africa as reported in the literature. The major conclusions that can be drawn from the review are (1) low-tech protected cultivation techniques are not suitable in all climatic conditions in sub-Saharan Africa and need to be combined with other methods to ensure adequate pest control, (2) the profitability of protected cultivation techniques relies on the capacity to offset increased production costs by higher yields and higher selling prices to be obtained with off-season and/or higher quality products, (3) breaking with existing cropping systems, the lack of technical support and skills, and the limited access to investment funding are major obstacles to the adoption of protected cultivation techniques by smallholders (4) life cycle assessments conducted in northern countries suggested that more efficient use of agricultural inputs would offset the negative impacts of protected cultivation techniques if they are properly managed, but further studies are required to be sure these results can be extrapolated to sub-Saharan Africa context.",Mixed,Yes,No,Maybe,Maybe,Mixed/Maybe,No,Unrated,Unrated,Maybe,"Is response-related/relevant, but not clear if this is truly empirical.

Here we report the discovery of a rare, multitaxic bonebed in the lower Halgaito Formation (Cutler Group) in Valley of the Gods and its vicinity (San Juan County), southeast Utah, USA. The assemblage, which comprises carcasses and disarticulated bones and teeth, preserves aquatic and semi-terrestrial elements including xenacanth chondrichthyans, actinopterygians, sagenodontid lungfish, and the temnospondyl amphibian Eryops, together with terrestrial taxa including the synapsids, Ophiacodon navajovicus, Edaphosaunrus, and Sphenacodon, and a hitherto undescribed araeoscelidan reptile.

The deposit probably formed through late stage flooding of a likely bottlenecked fluvial system, consistent with increasingly episodic or seasonal precipitation, concentrating carcasses of immature and mature shore-dwelling animals. Comparisons with vertebrate assemblages in the Cutler Group of New Mexico, USA suggest that the assemblage is correlative with the lower or middle assemblage of the El Cobre Canyon Formation (Cobrean and Coyotean Land Vertebrate Faunachrons; LVFs), and as such, is of latest Carboniferous age.

At landscape scales, climate impacts will be strongly mediated by disturbances, such as wildfire, which catalyze shifts in species distributions through widespread mortality and by shaping the post-disturbance environment. We examined the potential for regional shifts in low-elevation tree species in response to wildfire and climate warming in low-elevation, dry mixed-conifer forests of the northern Rocky Mountains, USA. We analyzed interactions among climate and wildfire on post-fire tree seedling regeneration 5-13 yr post-fire at 177 sites burned in 21 large wildfires during two years with widespread regional burning. We used generalized additive mixed models to quantify how the density of Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine seedlings varied as a function of climate normals (30-yr mean temperature, precipitation, soil moisture, and evapotranspiration) and fire (tree survivorship, burn severity, and seed source availability). Mean summer temperature was the most important predictor of post-fire seedling densities for both ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir. Seed availability was also important in determining Douglas-fir regeneration. As mean summer temperature continues to increase, however, seed availability will become less important for determining post-fire regeneration. Above a mean summer temperature of 17 degrees C, Douglas-fir regeneration is predicted to be minimal regardless of how close a seed source is to a site. The majority (82%) of our sampled sites are predicted to exceed a mean summer temperature of 17 degrees C by mid-century, suggesting significant declines in seedling densities and potential forest loss. Our results highlight mechanisms linking climate change to shifts in the distribution of two widely dominant tree species in western North America. Under a warming climate, we expect post-fire tree regeneration in these low-elevation forests to become increasingly unsuccessful.

Harnessing solar radiation holds the answer to reducing our dependence on fossil fuels. It is the most abundant energy resource and could meet humans’ future energy needs. The efficient conversion of solar radiation into stable, energy-dense liquid energy carriers that can use existing or adapt global supply chains for storage, shipping, and distribution is the key to large-scale deployment of solar energy at gigaton levels. Liquid sunshine is the vision of combining the sun's energy with carbon dioxide and water to produce green liquid fuels. CO2 released on using these fuels is recycled back into the environment, thus maintaining an ecologically balanced cycle. Multi-source and multi-purpose alcohols are optimal candidate fuels. Methanol and ethanol are actionable first targets with gigaton production potential. The intertwined goals of economic growth, environmental conservation, and energy security (3E) are pressing global challenges of our time. The paper discusses solutions to 3E goals, particularly in the context of developing countries that are most affected by climate change and local environmental degradation. 3E goals call for “common man solutions”; cheap, clean energy that can help combat hazardous pollution threatening public health and break the mutually reinforcing downward spiral of human poverty and environmental degradation. Alcohols are clean, affordable, multi-source, multi-purpose fuels that can rise to the call. The liquid sunshine roadmap charts stepwise technology advancements from intermediate technologies such as natural gas renewable hybrid systems to green systems for methanol production entirely from renewable energy. Intermediate solutions such as hybrid alcohols build production capacity, establish downstream markets, and begin the adaptation of existing supply chain infrastructure for subsequent widespread market penetration of alcohols in the global energy market. Hybrid alcohols also provide the “breathing space” until green technologies reach maturity for commercial production of green alcohols. Looking ahead, green alcohols and electricity can function as the dual pillars of green energy systems, with alcohol reservoirs forming the backbone. Such green energy systems can support myriad applications and services to build a sustainable future. Replacing fossil fuels with renewables will require efficient carriers of the sun's energy at gigaton scale. The diagram illustrates an ecologically balanced cycle where green alcohols are produced by combining sunshine with CO2 and H2O drawn from the environment and returned to the environment. Only the sun's energy is consumed in the cycle. Methanol, an example of a green alcohol, is a multi-purpose liquid energy carrier of the Sun's energy. It can also function as “liquid hydrogen” and “liquid electricity.” © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",No,No,No,No,No,Unrated,Unrated,Unrated,Unrated,Unrated,Mitigation focused.                    ,,,

Results showed that flood and drought were the major climate change impacts in the study area, and various participatory tools were used for risk assessment and undertaking action plans to overcome the climate change challenges by the group VDMC. Participation in VDMC generated both relational and technical outcomes. The relational outcomes are the informal institutional changes through which local community adopt technological adaptation measures. Although, limitations like bargaining problem, free riding or conflict were found in collective decision making, but the initiation of local governance like VDMC has brought various institutional change in the communities in terms of adaptation practices. More than 80% VDMC and around 40-55% non-VDMC household respondents agreed that overall community based adaptation process was successful in the previous year. They believed that some innovative practices had been brought in the community through VDMC action for climate change adaptation. No doubt that the CBA has achieved good progress to achieve the government Comprehensive Disaster Management (CDM) strategy of climate change adaptation. But, there is still lack of coordination among local government, NGOs and civil partners in working together. Research related to socio-economic impact analysis for the sustainability of adaptation measures implemented through local community could be undertaken in future. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Though there are social, economic and cultural opportunities associated with industry growth, climate change and a range of environmental risks and other problems present significant management challenges. This paper describes the growth in cruise tourism and pleasure craft travel in Canada's Nunavut Territory and then outlines issues and concerns related to existing management of both cruise and pleasure craft tourism. Strengths and areas for improvement are identified and recommendations for enhancing the cruise and pleasure craft governance regimes through strategic management are provided.

Ocean pH will change simultaneously with ocean warming and hypercapnia and all these stressors are likely to impact vulnerable early life history stages. To address questions on future vulnerabilities, data on thermo-and pH/pCO(2) tolerance of fertilisation and development, largely from single stressor physiology and ecotoxicology studies, are placed in a near future climate-relevant setting. Fertilisation exhibited a broad tolerance to warming or acidification beyond stressor values projected for 2100. Early development exhibited susceptibility to warming. For embryos that develop to the larval stage in a warm ocean, hypercapnia and acidification may impair calcification and other physiological processes. Sensitivities will vary between species.

Cold-water corals are considered to be among the most vulnerable organisms to ocean acidification because they are already exposed to relatively low pH and corresponding low calcium carbonate saturation states (Omega). Lophelia pertusa is a globally distributed cold-water scleractinian coral that provides critical three-dimensional habitat for many ecologically and economically significant species. In this study, four different genotypes of L. pertusa were exposed to three pH treatments (pH = 7.60, 7.75, and 7.90) over a short (2-week) experimental period, and six genotypes were exposed to two pH treatments (pH = 7.60 and 7.90) over a long (6-month) experimental period. Their physiological response was measured as net calcification rate and the activity of carbonic anhydrase, a key enzyme in the calcification pathway. In the short-term experiment, net calcification rates did not significantly change with pH, although they were highly variable in the low pH treatment, including some genotypes that maintained positive net calcification in undersaturated conditions. In the 6-month experiment, average net calcification was significantly reduced at low pH, with corals exhibiting net dissolution of skeleton. However, one of the same genotypes that maintained positive net calcification (+0.04% day(-1)) under the low pH treatment in the short-term experiment also maintained positive net calcification longer than the other genotypes in the long-term experiment, although none of the corals maintained positive calcification for the entire 6 months. Average carbonic anhydrase activity was not affected by pH, although some genotypes exhibited small, insignificant, increases in activity after the sixth month. Our results suggest that while net calcification in L. pertusa is adversely affected by ocean acidification in the long term, it is possible that some genotypes may prove to be more resilient than others, particularly to short perturbations of the carbonate system. These results provide evidence that populations of L. pertusa in the Gulf of Mexico may contain the genetic variability necessary to support an adaptive response to future ocean acidification.",No,No,No,No,No,Unrated,Unrated,Unrated,Unrated,Unrated,Natural systems focus only.                    ,,,

Within the last decade, the international development discourse has evolved to incorporate resilience thinking as a way to address more complex challenges. However, concrete examples as to how to operationalize resilience thinking are lacking. The Great Green Wall for the Sahara and the Sahel Initiative (GGW), a pan-African program with a strong reforestation focus, is the latest and most ambitious of these development programs to date. The GGW represents an ideal opportunity to apply resilience thinking at a large scale, but in order to do so, it must intelligently gather and centralize pre-existing interdisciplinary knowledge, generate new knowledge, and integrate knowledge systems to appropriately navigate future uncertainties of the diverse social-ecological systems along its path. Herein, after a brief description of large-scale reforestation history in the Sahara and Sahel and the conceptual evolution of the GGW, we propose a transdisciplinary research framework with resilience thinking at its core. It includes analysis of complex social-ecological systems, their temporal and spatial cross-scale interactions, and outcomes focused on the supply of abundant, diverse, equitable, and durable ecosystem services to support livelihoods in the region.

In this review, we synthetize recent advances in molecular biology and evolutionary biology to outline sonic potentially important effects of stressors on fish across biological levels. Given the burgeoning literature, we highlight four promising avenues of research. First, (1) the exposure to multiple stressors can lead to unexpected synergistic or antagonistic effects, which should be better Liken into account to improve our predictions of the effects of actual and future human activities on aquatic organisms. Second, (2) we argue that such interactive effects might be clue to switches in energy metabolism leading to threshold effects. Under multiple stress exposure, fish could switch from a ""compensation"" strategy, i.e. a reallocation of energy to defenses and repair to a ""conservation"" strategy, i.e. blocking of stress responses leading to strong deleterious effects and high mortality. Third, (3) this could have cascading effects on fish survival and population persistence but multiscale studies are still rare. We propose emerging tools merging different levels of biological organization to better predict population resilience under multiple stressors. Fourth (4), there are strong variations in sensitivity among populations, which might arise from transgenerational effects of stressors through plastic, genetic, and epigenetic mechanisms. This can lead to local adaptation or maladaptation, with strong impacts on the evolutionary trajectories of wild fish populations. With this review, we hope to encourage future research to bridge the gap between molecular ecology, ecotoxicology and evolutionary biology to better understand the evolution of responses of fishes to current and future multiple stressors in the context of global changes.

This site sits at the heart of the intersection zone of the East Asian and Indian summer monsoons - a climatic system that is socio-ecologically important but poorly understood. Proxies for lake deepening and shallowing indicate a stepwise weakening of the summer monsoon from c. 4700 to 1700 cal. years BP, after which it appears to gradually strengthen. This trend is punctuated by seven dry events between 4300 and 1540 cal. years BP. The results present one of the longest, continuous records of palaeo-hydrological change in the Asian monsoon intersection zone. In doing so, they suggest that the climate of the region was broadly comparable to the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) province to approximately 2240 cal. years BP, and the Indian summer monsoon (ISM) province between 2240 and 1700 cal. years BP. The subsequent, late Holocene hydroclimate appears to reflect a combination of both subsystems. These findings highlight dynamism in EASM and ISM dominance over mainland southeast Asia over the past five thousand years, but overall demonstrate regional vs. local scale influence on the hydroclimate of the region. The multi-decadal periods of strong drying that punctuate longer-term monsoon patterns demonstrate the natural variability of the mid- to late- Holocene climate of the intersection zone. This is of consequence given that apparently less severe drought events of the last millennium have had dramatic socio-economic consequences. Resultantly, planning for the resilience of socio-ecological systems within the region needs to account for the real potential of similar scale events occurring in the future, particularly given the increased extremes predicted for Asian summer monsoon region over the 21st century.",No,No,No,No,No,Unrated,Unrated,Unrated,Unrated,Unrated,Historic.                    ,,,

By tracking skeletal stress band formation through the 2015-16 El Nino, which killed 95% of Jarvis corals, we validate their utility as proxies of bleaching severity and show that 2015-16 was not the first catastrophic bleaching event on Jarvis. Since 1960, eight severe (>30% bleaching) and two moderate (<30% bleaching) events occurred, each coinciding with El Nino. While the frequency and severity of bleaching on Jarvis did not increase over this time period, 2015-16 was unprecedented in magnitude.

To date, RI forecasts have been completed using linear discriminant analysis (LDA) on predictors optimized for RI forecasts, and no study has directly addressed machine learning's (hereafter AI) capability in forecasting RI. As such, the objective of this study is to quantify the RI predictability using proxy forecast model data and an ensemble of AI methods to generate probabilistic RI forecasts. Atlantic RI events from 1985 to 2011 were retained for all valid times (over water) for each TC, and these cases were used to train an AI ensemble optimized (through three steps) for RI prediction. First, backwards elimination feature selection was used on a blend of the proxy forecast data, predictors from the currently utilized LDA model, and observed TC track information (such as intensity and position) to optimize the predictor suite. Second, numerous configurations of three AI methods (support vector machines [SVMs], artificial neural networks [ANNs], and random forests [RFs]) were tested using bootstrap-based cross-validation to ascertain the best configurations of each AI method. Finally, the best AI configurations were used to generate probabilistic output for RI, weighted by each ensemble member's individual cross-validation performance. Resulting probabilistic forecasts were in line with the current LDA method, though the upper skill limit of the ensemble exceeded 30% improvement over climatology, which far exceeds the current LDA scheme.

Seeds were collected from a single site in three consecutive years and exposed to multiple laboratory-based fire'-related temperature treatments (intensity x duration). Experiments were conducted on seeds freshly collected and after 12months storage under dry laboratory conditions in order to separate the influence of the maternal environment from post-harvest storage conditions on thresholds for dormancy release. Initial seed viability and non-dormant seed fraction did not differ between seed cohorts but there was a clear effect of storage on seed response: fresh seeds from 2016 demonstrated greater thermal resilience than stored seeds collected in the same year. Equally, there was a strong inter-annual response to treatments from fresh seeds collected in 2016 and 2017 attributed to the influence of the maternal environment during seed development. Seeds collected in 2015 and 2016 and stored for 12months also demonstrated significant differences in their response to treatments, with 2015 seeds responding more favourably to treatment conditions than those from 2016. Plastic responses to external stimuli provide seeds with a strong bet-hedging capacity and the potential to cope with high levels of environmental heterogeneity, especially a mosaic of fire conditions.

2390483,https://apsis.mcc-berlin.net/scoping/document/193/2390483/,Latest Development of the national and international EMC-Standards for Electric Vehicles and their Charging Infrastructure,"For a long term success of electric mobility, it's definitely necessary to provide safe charging infrastructures in addition to marketable vehicles. Since safety and functionality requirements on every electric mobility product are extremely high, the interoperability between charging infrastructure and vehicle, as well as the interaction of both systems under every possible environmental condition and parameter variations are significant. In addition to climatic and mechanical influences, electromagnetic influence, e. g. broadcast transmitter, mobile phones, the disturbances caused by the systems themselves and the sensibility to each other, belongs also to environmental requirement [1]. Focusing on the Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) of the charging infrastructure of these vehicles, the normative standards have to be adapted to these new circumstances. In this paper, several critical issues, especially the controversial discussed aspects regarding EMC in the draft version of IEC 61851-21-2, which is an EMC standard for conductive charging infrastructure, are demonstrated according to the diverse charging modes and the special interfaces to energy supply networks.",No,No,No,No,No,Unrated,Unrated,Unrated,Unrated,Unrated,Mitigation focused.                    ,,,

2453329,https://apsis.mcc-berlin.net/scoping/document/193/2453329/,Improving water use efficiency for ornamental crops grown in greenhouses: A substrate-plant-Atmosphere model validation for transpiration prediction,"In greenhouses, reducing water consumption by increasing water efficiency is of high interest. Water need is linked to the plant transpiration, which itself depends on the stomatal resistance (Rs). Up until now however, prediction of Rs through models was mainly conducted for well-watered plants in open field conditions and very few models exist for greenhouse plants grown in pots. The aim of this work was to develop a dynamic model of Rs based on the full factorial design (FFD) under water restriction conditions. Then, the model was validated inside a greenhouse. The FFD is based on an optimization process to establish a polynomial relationship between Rs and the radiation, humidity and temperature. To implement the model, a set of experiments was conducted inside a 10 m2 growth chamber equipped with Impatiens New Guinea planted in 0.74-L pots under well-watered conditions. Rs was measured with a porometer and nine climatic scenarios were tested. First the FFD model was implemented for well-watered conditions. Then it was adapted to calculate Rs under water restriction, through the introduction of a new multiplicative function depending on the growing media matric potential. Once these parameters had been determined, the obtained transpiration model was validated against experimental data recorded inside a greenhouse Impatiens crop. The transpiration model derived from the FFD method showed its ability to correctly simulate Rs under water restriction conditions. Hence, it could be useful to accurately predict the evolution of transpiration.",No,No,No,No,No,Unrated,Unrated,Unrated,Unrated,Unrated,Not relevant to climate change   ,,,
2454349,https://apsis.mcc-berlin.net/scoping/document/193/2454349/,Wind measurements campaigns off shore how they create value for wind farms,"Currently the cost of the traditional solution for offshore wind measurement, a hub-height lattice met mast on a fixed foundation within the windfarm boundary, has become extortionately expensive, primarily due to a number of factors, which include: the deeper waters at current project sites, the more severe wave climates at current project sites, the vessels able to work under such conditions including the mobilisation costs for a one-off operation.However an accurate knowledge of the wind resource allows improved decision making and reduces risk, in terms of the windfarm design as well as the investment decision; for the investment decision, risks to project finance also need to be considered. A suitable designed measurement campaign delivers a positive NPV, since the financial return required is lower on a less risky investment. This risk reduction can be quantified via different means, depending upon the project structure. A widely understood approach is the improvements in the project finance conditions that a lender would grant to the project, specifically how much project debt can be offered. Figure 1 presents the normalised NPV for leading candidate wind measurement strategies for an offshore wind farm scenario: the reference case is to make no measurements and to use a regional wind atlas, preferably based on a multitude of source including satellite data, measurements where available and mesoscale analyses; i.e. methodology such as described in reference [2]; if a nearby windfarm has a met mast with a number of years of data, this may well deliver significant value; a new conventional met mast on a fixed foundation has been the default wind measurement strategy to date but will be expensive; it will deliver high quality measurement data, subject to appropriate design and operation; a LiDAR unit on a light-weight jacket (termed LiGA within this paper) will be a lower cost strategy; LiDAR has become widely acceptable as the primary source of windspeed measurements, for both onshore and offshore sites; the viability of the structure is subject to suitable ground conditions; the vertical LiDAR measurements could be augment by horizontal measurements with a scanning LiDAR for a relatively low additional cost, thus providing data on variation of windspeeds across the windfarm site; note that a single location of measurement means that only radial rather than full 2D vector wind-fields can be determined, thus reducing the value of the campaign compared with a full dual unit strategy; a number of floating LiDAR concepts are currently under development, including undergoing field testing; the relatively low cost and rapid deployment possible makes such a strategy highly attractive however currently widespread acceptance across the investment community and their advisers is currently lacking, hence deployment as primary source of wind measurement data introduces strategic risk; if the windfarm site is located close to the coast, within the range of scanning LiDAR units located at the shoreline, it would be possible to measure the full wind-field across the windfarm site; the advantages of lower costs and rapid deployment are countered by disadvantages of lack of trials, a prerequisite for commencing route towards widespread acceptance within the investment community. Clearly the project characteristics as well as uncertainty assumptions will drive the value creating by candidate wind measurement strategies and Figure 1 presents the results for just one example of an imaginary offshore windfarm. Details of the underlying assumptions are presented in the main body of the paper. A benchmarking exercise was also undertaken against a Bona-fide windfarm project Financial Model, which delivered good agreement. Finally, under typical conditions, increasing the certainty regarding any project in a development portfolio will also deliver benefits to the portfolio as a whole, allowing: prioritisation of projects during the development phase selection of projects for realisation at FID An indicative analytical model was developed to undertake a preliminary investigation of potential scale of such benefits which suggested these could be in the order of €10m. Note that this principal will apply to any portfolio, whether solely of offshore wind projects, or of a mix of offshore wind projects together with other investment opportunities.",No,No,No,No,No,Unrated,Unrated,Unrated,Unrated,Unrated,Not climate change relevant,,,
2457768,https://apsis.mcc-berlin.net/scoping/document/193/2457768/,Blueprint and implementation of rural stand-alone power grids with second-life lithium ion vehicle traction battery systems for resilient energy supply of tropical or remote regions,"Developed societies with advanced economic performance are undoubtedly coupled with the availability of electrical energy. Whilst industrialized nations already started to decrease associated carbon emissions in many business sectors, e.g., by substituting combustion engines with battery-powered vehicles, less developed countries still lack broad coverage of reliable electricity supply, particularly in rural regions. Progressive electrification leads to a need for storage capacity and thus to increasing availability of advanced battery systems. To achieve a high degree of sustainability, re-used batteries from the electromobility sector are appropriate, as they do not consume further primary resources and still have sufficient residual capacity for stationary electrical storage applications. In this article, a blueprint for the electrification of a remote region by utilizing second-life lithium ion traction batteries for an integrated energy system in a stand-alone grid is presented and the implementation by the example case of a Tanzanian island in Lake Victoria is demonstrated. First, economic potentials and expected trends in the disposability of second-life lithium ion batteries and their foreseeable costs are outlined. Subsequently, key decision variables are identified to evaluate logistic aspects and the feasibility of the implementation of an off-grid electrical system in remote areas for economically and geographically unfavorable environments. The practical realization is pictured in detail with a focus on technical performance and safety specificities associated with second-life applications. Therefore, a new type of battery management system is introduced, which meets the special requirements of climate compatibility, low maintenance, enhanced cell balancing capability and cell configuration flexibility, and combined with a fiber-optical sensor system, provides reliable status monitoring of the battery. By carrying out on-site measurements, the overall system efficiency is evaluated along with a sustainability analysis. Finally, the socioeconomic and humanitarian impact for the people on the island is debated. © 2019 by the authors.",Mixed,No,No,No,Yes,Mixed/Maybe,Unrated,Unrated,Unrated,Maybe,Mitigation focused.                    ,,,
2462066,https://apsis.mcc-berlin.net/scoping/document/193/2462066/,Effects of latitudinal and elevational gradients exceed the effects of between-cytotype differences in eco-physiological leaf traits in diploid and triploid Hieracium alpinum,"Polyploidy may affect a species’ eco-physiology, which might, in turn, trigger a shift in the distribution of its cytotypes. The arcto-alpine Hieracium alpinum (Asteraceae) encompasses two geographically allopatric cytotypes: diploids occurring in the South-Eastern Carpathians and triploids occupying the remaining, much larger part of the species range. We ask whether the natural populations of these two cytotypes, growing under partially different biotic and abiotic conditions, also differ in selected eco-physiological traits. To answer this question, we analyzed specific leaf area, foliar carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) contents, and their stable isotope compositions in plants sampled in 27 populations across the species range. Our results did not show any differences in these traits, except foliar N content being significantly higher in diploids. This pattern was mostly driven by the Scandinavian triploid populations exposed to significantly lower amounts of solar radiation and precipitation during the growing season when compared to the continental populations. As a consequence, in addition to lower foliar N content, the Scandinavian populations exhibited also lower foliar C content, but higher C/N ratios than continental populations regardless of their cytotype. Across the species range, foliar N and C contents were positively associated with the amount of precipitation, whilst δ15N was positively associated with temperature and negatively with the surrounding species richness and vegetation cover. Significantly lower values of δ13C in Scandinavian populations are likely the effect of increased atmospheric pressure due to the lower elevational position of Scandinavian sites. Reproductive output was positively linked to amounts of foliar nitrogen and δ15N. Our data thus show that (1) the latitudinal-driven abiotic and biotic factors affected eco-physiological traits in significantly larger extent than ploidy level and that (2) continental and Scandinavian populations, though all confined to the alpine belt, considerably differ in their eco-physiology likely reflecting different adaptation strategies. © 2018, Swiss Botanical Society.",No,No,No,No,No,Unrated,Unrated,Unrated,Unrated,Unrated,Natural systems focus only                    ,,,
2463082,https://apsis.mcc-berlin.net/scoping/document/193/2463082/,Structure and function of the mammalian middle ear. I: Large middle ears in small desert mammals,"Many species of small desert mammals are known to have expanded auditory bullae. The ears of gerbils and heteromyids have been well described, but much less is known about the middle ear anatomy of other desert mammals. In this study, the middle ears of three gerbils (Meriones, Desmodillus and Gerbillurus), two jerboas (Jaculus) and two sengis (elephant-shrews: Macroscelides and Elephantulus) were examined and compared, using micro-computed tomography and light microscopy. Middle ear cavity expansion has occurred in members of all three groups, apparently in association with an essentially 'freely mobile' ossicular morphology and the development of bony tubes for the middle ear arteries. Cavity expansion can occur in different ways, resulting in different subcavity patterns even between different species of gerbils. Having enlarged middle ear cavities aids low-frequency audition, and several adaptive advantages of low-frequency hearing to small desert mammals have been proposed. However, while Macroscelides was found here to have middle ear cavities so large that together they exceed brain volume, the bullae of Elephantulus are considerably smaller. Why middle ear cavities are enlarged in some desert species but not others remains unclear, but it may relate to microhabitat. © 2016 Anatomical Society.",No,No,No,No,No,Unrated,Unrated,Unrated,Unrated,Unrated,Not climate change relevant; natural systems focus only                    ,,,
